# ETL-Process-using-Python-to-update-database-stored-in-SQL-Server-

In this project, the ETL process for our company project, <b><i>Tender data Insight</b></i>, is a bit different from normal ETL process.

The data is in extremly poor quality due to the fact that the data is collected in pdf file then being converted into excel file, which will have lots of incorrect data.

This leads to lots of resources for the cleaning data process. Thus, after every finished cleaning process, the data will be loaded back into the database to prevent repeated process.

## ETL Steps: ##
<b>1. Import libraries</b><br>
<b>2. Explore the dataset</b><br>
<b>3. Data processing</b><br>
<b>4. Update/Load data back to SQL Server</b><br>
<b>5. Complete code (incl for loop)</b><br>

From step 1 to step 4: it will highlight the process to perform ETL process for one dataset that need to be update, however in step 5 it will include all the previous steps in order to perform ETL for numerous files that need to be loaded back to the database.
